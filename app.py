    In Python, a constructor is a special method that is called automatically when an object is created from a class.
    Its main role is to initialize the object by setting up its attributes or state.
    The method __new__ is the constructor that creates a new instance of the class, while __init__ is the initializer that sets up 
    the instanceâ€™s attributes after creation. These methods work together to manage object creation and initialization.
